Happy summer! Thank you so much for keeping up to date with the happenings of this scholarship and those it impacts! We are thankful for the community you all have built around it and are excited to continue to grow it. 
It is with great excitement that we get to announce the winners of this years scholarship, Olivia Martinez and Jade Moore! 

Olivia won the first prize and was an all around outstanding student, completing both the SEBS Biomedical and Engineering programs. On top of her SEBS involvement, she also participated in Girl's Cabinet, National Honor Society, and Health Occupation Students of America. 

Olivia is planning on attending Duquesne University in the fall double majoring in biomedical engineering and nursing. Olivia credits SEBS with inspiring her to pursue these degrees. 

When asked about how SEBS has impacted her, Olivia wrote, " It’s crazy to think that a decision I made four years ago has played such a large role in the next four years of my education! When I decided to go to County High School, which was truly a decision to attend SEBS, I didn’t realize how significant my experience would be. I’m so grateful to be a SEBS graduate because the small environment has led me to form lasting relationships with educators and peers. Both the educational and life lessons I’ve learned as a SEBS student have strengthened me and truly prepared me for my higher education, the work place, and life as an adult. I’m sad to say I won’t be able to build and design projects in the engineering room, learn about the human body in Mrs. Bowker’s classroom, or make memories on the annual HOSA trip to the state conference any longer, but all of these experiences have given me amazing memories and tangible skills I’m excited to take with me to college!"

Our second prize goes to Jade this year. Jade was an incredibly accomplished student, completing the SEBS Engineering program while balancing being NHS President, Student Body Vice President, participating in swimming all four years, speech and debate for three and on top of that, being active in girl's cabinet! Jade's next step is to start at University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Civil Engineering. When asked about how SEBS impacted her, Jade replied, "SEBS truly is an amazing program. I was surrounded with friends and peers that academically challenged me and the engineering program confirmed my interest in engineering and made me confident enough to make a career out of it."
