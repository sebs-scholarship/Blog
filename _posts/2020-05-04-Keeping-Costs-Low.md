## Keeping Costs Low

As a non-profit organization funded solely by charitable donations, one of the first factors we consider when making any
decision is cost. We strive to keep our overhead expenses as low as possible so that recipients of our scholarship get
every penny possible. Throughout this post, I will discuss how we at SSF keep our operating costs to a minimum, and
what tools we use to get the most out of our donations!

## Donation Processing

In order to keep as much of our donations as we can, we use a few different platforms to accept donations.

First off, on we have a [donation form](https://sebsscholarship.org/#section-donate) on our website powered by
[Donorbox](https://donorbox.org/). Using this platform is **free** for your first **$1000** processed per month, which is
more than enough for our needs. The only overhead cost is
[Stripe's discounted fee for non-profits](https://support.stripe.com/questions/fee-discount-for-nonprofit-organizations),
which is the lowest rates we were able to find. Donorbox uses Stripe to process its payments.

Additionally, we've found that [Facebook fundraisers](https://www.facebook.com/help/833144153745643) have a great
engagement rate, and with **$0** in any sort of fees, it's a perfect solution for small and large non-profits alike!


## Communication Platforms

In order to communicate and track our tasks, we use a variety of free tools!

### Messaging

First off, for everyday communications and general chatting, we use a platform known as [Discord](https://discord.gg).

Though it's designed for use within the gaming community, many businesses and organization have recognized the value of
its many features, such as screen sharing, group voice and text chats, easily configurable user permissions and roles,
and the ability to make multiple "channels" or chats for users based on topic, which is why it's our main communication
platform.

### Email

When communicating with those outside of the organization, we like to use our custom email addresses. For example, we
have users email us at [help@sebsscholarship.org](mailto:help@sebsscholarship.org). With our *free*
[DreamHost](https://dreamhost.com) hosting package, we were given unlimited email accounts with unlimited storage. We'll
discuss the details of this package more in the following sections.

Additionally, [Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/) also has great business email solutions.

### Task Management and Organization

To ensure that everyone is on the same page and is aware of all updates to specific tasks, we use a website know as
[Trello](https://trello.com/). Combined with [Google Drive](http://google.com/drive/), Trello makes it easy to track a
task's progress as well as attach relevant files and carry on discussions related to the task.

## Our Website

In today's world, one of the most critical assets for any organization is their website. This is the face of the
organization and must not only look nice, but also be easily navigable for your users. Hiring a developer to build the
site may costs thousands of dollars, and site maintenance will likely end up costing more than the initial cost over
 time. Below are some tips for building your site for a low cost.


### Look for Non-profit Hosting Discounts

To make your website available to your audience, you'll need to use a hosting provider. At SSF, we use
[DreamHost's **free** shared hosting plan for non-profits](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/215769478-Non-profit-discount)
which allows us to host our website [sebsscholarship.org](https://sebsscholarship.org) as well as our test sites for free!

Additionally, [GitHub](https://github.com) allows you to host a website through
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for **free** as well. We use this service to host our
[SSF Blog](https://blog.sebsscholarship.org/) and our
[Identification Assignment Tool](https://idat.sebsscholarship.org). This service is great, however accepting payments
through the service is against its Terms and Conditions, which is why we use [DreamHost](https://dreamhost.com) for
our main website.

### Finding a Web Developer

Having an in-house developer will definitely help any organization keep their operating costs low, especially if your
organization relies on volunteer work.  For a simple website, you don't need a software engineer, just someone that's
experienced in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

At SSF, we have an in-house developer who wrote all of our different websites. The developer is actually a volunteer and
updates the site as they are able. That being said, not everyone knows a developer willing to do volunteer work, but
it's worth seeing if anyone is interested.

*Can't find a developer?* There are website generators and templates available, however these usually come with a cost.
This may be the easiest thing for your organization, but you will be limited to what the generator or template is
capable of, and you may not have much control over the look or structure of your site.

### Don't Reinvent the Wheel When Making Your Site

When building your website, it's okay to use pre-made templates. In fact, it can save hundreds of hours of development.
Just be aware many templates have a fee for commercial use, but this is often worth the price.

For the [SSF Blog](https://blog.sebsscholarship.org), we use an open-source software called
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build our website based on a series of templates. To make a new post, we just write
the post's main content in a simplified code known as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which
allows us to make posts without having to know web development.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) also allows you to use plenty of freely available
templates for your site, so you can get started making posts without even having to code your own templates!

### Buying a Domain

One of the most important steps to making a website is to have a recognizable domain. For example, we own the domain
[sebsscholarship.org](https://sebsscholarship.org). Purchasing a domain name is very easy! We got our domain name
for only **$12 a year** from [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).

An alternative solution is to get a domain for **free** from [DreamHost](https://dreamhost.com/) with the purchase of a
website hosting package. Your website will need to be hosted somewhere for others to access, so bundling may make more
sense for your organization. We are provided a **free** domain for **one year** with our non-profit discount.

*Is the domain you want already taken?* At this point, the easiest solution is to try to find an alternate domain name.
If you're really set on having a specific domain name, you'll have to reach out to the domain's owner and negotiate a
price with them. You can use a third-party to help broker the deal, but you can think of the process like trying to buy
someone's house that isn't for-sale. You might get lucky though and grab a deal!

## Summary

By using free and open source tools, we're able to keep our operating costs to a minimum despite the amount of resources
we host online. By implementing all the steps above, we've managed to get our total costs for our technology down to
 **only $12 per year total**! Looking for non-profit discounts and searching for open source tools can be a huge payoff
 for any non-profit needing to save some money!
