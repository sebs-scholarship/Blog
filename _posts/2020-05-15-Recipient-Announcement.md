## Announcing the 2020 SEBS Scholarship Recipient…

The past few months have been a whirlwind of change and emotion for many, particularly seniors everywhere who were unable to complete their final year of high school the way they imagined. The SEBS Scholarship changed quite a bit, too, in the months, weeks, and even days leading up to the announcement of our inaugural scholarship results. Hopefully, the changes we made are able to bring a little bit of light to a trying time and reinvigorate the excitement of the future.

We are incredibly proud of all the graduates and want to extend the biggest *CONGRATULATIONS* for your accomplishment! We are confident that you will go on to do amazing things in all your future endeavors, whatever they are!

### Surprise! Additional awards!

The scholarship applications we received met and exceeded our expectations for SEBS graduates! You blew us away with your commitment to your studies and extracurricular activities, drive to better yourselves and the world around you, and resilience to challenges you’ve faced along the way.

We decided to increase this year’s award to **first *and* second place** prizes!
 
**First place:** $900 scholarship to selected college + $100 gift card to the student for college-related expenses

**Second place:** $100 gift card to the student for college-related expenses
