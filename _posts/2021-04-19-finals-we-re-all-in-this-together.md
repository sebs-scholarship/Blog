Well, folks, there’s just one thing standing between us and summer. The dreaded, the feared, the breakdown-inducing: Finals. So close to freedom, yet so far. That one week seems to drag on for years. This week is about one thing, getting through to the other side. It’s daunting but I know you can do it! Here are some tips and reminders to get you (and me) through.

## 1. Shake it up

I can sometimes get caught in my habits- I have a couple of study methods I always jump to, even if it’s not that effective. Give flashcards a try, or recite your study objectives to your roommates, see if you can make a song or a joke to help you remember equations or concepts. If you’re hitting a wall, try changing your location, or working with a group.

## 2. Brain food

Don’t forget to nourish yourself! If you are one to only eat salad, give yourself permission to down a pint of ice cream- you deserve it. If you are one to starve when stressed, set alarms every couple of hours to remind you to snack. If you’re one to stress eat, make sure you’re getting a variety of veggies, fruit, carbs, fats, protein, etc. Carry a water bottle with you, and try not to overdo it on the caffeine.

## 3. See the light of day

Studying for hours on end can be discouraging. After a certain point, having your head stuck in the books can become counterproductive. Make sure to schedule something fun. Go see a friend, go to the gym, go out to eat, do something that makes you feel like yourself again. And don’t forget to do something fun to celebrate after each test or project!

## 4. Sleep is for the sane

The temptation to pull an all-nighter is real, but you won’t perform as well if you don’t have sleep. If you really have to work through the night, try a polyphasic approach, work for a couple of hours, take a 30-minute nap, repeat. Try to make the next day especially relaxing, and schedule in a power nap if you can.

## 5. All things come to an end

Remember, even if you fail, even if finals are a total disaster, in the grand scheme of things, it is only a blip. How you perform on tests and projects is not a reflection of your self-worth. In 10 years, you won’t even remember this week. Try your best and leave the rest up to fate.

_A short note on suicide prevention: Suicide rates peak during exams for high school and college students. If you are struggling, or you suspect someone you know is in danger, seek help as soon as possible. You can text HOME to 741741 or call 1-800-273-8255 for 24/7 support. Your life is worth more than any grade._

And it's back to studying for me, we’re gonna get through this, good luck!
