Happy March everyone!  
I hope everyone had a good St. Patrick's day and is excited for the coming spring!

Our scholarship application just closed and we can not be more excited about this year's group. Right now the review team is working on reading all the applications to find this year's recipient which will be announced at senior night.  
In the meantime, we wanted to introduce this year's board which started serving their term in December.

Levi Muniz has been serving on the board for multiple years now but we are beyond thankful to continue to have his leadership as president.

Natalie Anderson is serving her second year as vice president and is also helping with the scholarship's social media presence.

Aaron Duran is serving a dual role as both treasurer and secretary and works hard to keep the organization running.

Lucie has been with the organization since the very beginning and continues to work hard putting together the scholarship application and review process.

We are excited to see what this year has in store and to get to know you all better!
