Currently: Biochemistry, minors in Sociology, Biomedical Engineering, and Bioinformatics at The University of Tulsa; General Chemistry Lab TA

Online classes have been keeping me pretty busy so far, but I’ve been spending more time with my family. Once I’m done with finals, I’m looking forward to reading more books on my to-read list, doing more handstands, and studying for the MCAT, eek!

**SEBS Class of 2017, Engineering**

Currently: Music-Vocal Performance with Music Production and Composition at CSU-Pueblo

I have begun composing a few songs, which use some new techniques for me, such as [Winter Nights](https://flat.io/score/5e7ecfe5c786cb4ccc474b28-chr15-15-b0r3d?sharingKey=4d282cf040eca65c01fdb8a7ab0f05cc6ba8a94ee19aea71cda1b5174eefddcc8c163fa7678c7be1984a7f40d649738fced5f2985d0b6195b1a1c4303a954933).

I have also been working on a few projects with production and performance and look forward to releasing new music.

Other than music, I have been talking to my friends and fraternity brothers, making plans for after quarantine, and even how we can reasonably try to help people during quarantine without adding to the current crisis. I have been staying home and encourage everyone to do the same.

Currently: Business Management and Accounting at PCC; Shipping & Purchases Manager, Safety Coordinator at Refractories West Inc.

I most enjoy relaxing on the farm with my dogs Bailey, Gus, and Lena, our cat Jack, our horse Bitzy, and our goat Zeke. I also volunteer at Christ the King Catholic Parish teaching children worship. I’m so happy to be a part of the SEBS Scholarship Foundation and can’t wait to see what amazing things the SEBS students are capable of!

In social isolation I am enjoying painting, cross stitching, playing board games with my roommate and caring for my many houseplants. Stay sane, stay safe friends! xo
