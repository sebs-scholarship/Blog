Hey y'all! I hope you've had a fantastic holiday weekend! Today is the last of a series of modern festive days, following Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, and Cyber Monday. Today is GIVING TUESDAY!

### What is Giving Tuesday?

Giving Tuesday is a global movement to celebrate generosity! It seeks to recognize that everyone has the opportunity to support charitable organizations through giving their time, talents, and treasures.

### YOU can help us help SEBS students!

As a non-profit charity, we function exclusively through donations for the scholarships and the time and talents of our team. Our team is made entirely of volunteers, and we are all SEBS/PCHS alumni. You can read more about us and our mission [here](https://sebsscholarship.org/#section-about "About Us").

**This year, we are selling SEBS Scholarship Foundation t-shirts, face masks, and more for a limited time!** These make great gifts, and over 50% of your purchase will go straight to future scholarships!

#### [**Visit the shop HERE**](https://teespring.com/stores/ssf-merch "SHOP") **before it closes on December 14!**

_We are so thankful for our community and the experiences we had in SEBS! Your support really does make a difference!_ Because of your contributions, in May, we were able to award $1100 in scholarships to [two SEBS graduates](https://blog.sebsscholarship.org/2020/05/15/Recipient-Announcement.html "Recipient Announcement"). We recently had the chance to catch up with Marianna Benitez, the first-place awardee, and you can watch our conversation [here](https://youtu.be/bnG27dGaTu8 "conversation")!
