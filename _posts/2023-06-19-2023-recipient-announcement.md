        <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><i>"The greatest thing SEBS did was strengthen my determination to succeed. In the coming years, I will be attending Colorado State University Pueblo as a nursing student, hoping to eventually join in aiding my community at Parkview hospital. I enjoyed every moment of SEBS biomedical program, minus the late nights, staying up till 3 am to study. However, all those moments made me into the student I am today, and I could not be more grateful for it. I am incredibly honored to be a recipient of this award. Thank you to all the donors and staff who made this opportunity possible, you have blessed me and will continue to bless many students in the future."</i></p>

Throughout my time at SEBS, it has shaped my aspirations to aim higher and drove me to find ways to better myself in hopes of achieving something worthwhile.  I express my sincere appreciation for being awarded the SEBS Scholarship which is driven by the extraordinary generosity of the donors and foundation members. I hope this foundation continues its invaluable impact on the lives of future SEBS graduates, enabling them to thrive and succeed in their endeavors."</i></p>
