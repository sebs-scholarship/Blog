Recently, I got the chance to chat and catch up with my former SEBS classmate Mark Hedrick, who has since graduated from CSU-P with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems. Mark is an incredibly accomplished alumnus, and he had some great experiences and advice to share, including some surprises!

_"Looking back at SEBS, I felt that the English courses that I took there were super helpful in what I do every day."_
