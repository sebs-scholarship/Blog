## 5 Youtube Channels for College Students

My FAVORITE way to learn is through YouTube videos- what can I say, I love being ‘spoon fed.’ Here are 5 YouTube channels that have given me legit life advice.

### 1. 2 Cents

This husband and wife financial advisor team works with PBS digital studios and creates short, and super helpful videos to help you understand money. Watching this channel has improved my financial literacy and my credit score. Here’s a video about how to apply for student aid: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W13fqrUMTco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W13fqrUMTco "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W13fqrUMTco")

### 2. Crash Course

This one is pretty obvious; Crash Course has a huge library of content, and is especially helpful for your generals. These have helped me pass Chemistry and 2 physics classes!

### 3. How to ADHD

Even if you don’t have ADHD, everyone has a hard time motivating themselves or concentrating at times. I just KNOW there’s something you're supposed to be doing right now. These videos are so helpful for understanding why we struggle and how to help ourselves: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM0Xv0eVGtY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM0Xv0eVGtY "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM0Xv0eVGtY")

### 4. NancyPi

NancyPi is the ONLY person who helped me understand calculus. Seriously, she’s amazing, and an MIT grad! She talks slow, does practice problems, and explains concepts in such a clear way.

### 5. The Take

This one isn’t exactly college related, but it’s definitely my edutainment of choice. The Take is a female-led film critique channel with essay-style videos. They talk about social issues through the lense of media and it is just _Chef’s kiss_ quality.
