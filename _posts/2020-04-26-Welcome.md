## Welcome to the SEBS Scholarship Foundation blog!

We’re glad you’re here! Here we’ll post scholarship updates, event information, college and application tips from our volunteers, and announcements from the Foundation.

### 2020 Scholarship Updates?

As of the post date, we are busy reading all of the 2020 applications and choosing the finalists. We will announce the winner of the scholarship by **May 14**.

We are LOVING all of the applications we received, and we are confident that every one of you will go on to do great things! You rock!

### We Need Your Feedback!

If you are a SEBS senior (whether you applied for the scholarship or not), we would really appreciate it if you could fill out this [feedback form](https://forms.gle/eqVD7GPhCsWQVdTY8). This will help us make the SEBS Scholarship a better experience for future classes! In addition, if you’d like to help us administer the scholarship for future classes, [get in touch with us to volunteer](https://forms.gle/PGQbzymeGPz1E7U27). We’d love your help!

### ...and a Free Resource for You!

Finally, if you still haven’t decided on a college yet, we’ve created a [free college decision matrix tool](/assets/documents/College_Decision_Matrix.xlsx) to help!

We’ve got some more posts planned in the coming weeks, but for now, feel free to explore our main site and learn more about us.

Until next time!
