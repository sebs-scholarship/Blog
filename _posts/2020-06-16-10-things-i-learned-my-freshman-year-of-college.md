College. Is. Amazing. Not everything went smoothly my freshman year of college, but it was so much better than I ever imagined! Aside from the actual academic stuff, here are 10 things I learned my freshman year of college:

## **1. COMMUNITY BATHROOMS AREN’T SO BAD**

In my dorm, they were cleaned every day, which meant no cleaning for me! And there was never a time when all the showers were being used.

## **2. YOU CAN’T SAY YES TO EVERYTHING**

This applies to two situations: extracurricular activities/clubs and hanging out with your friends. Eventually, if you signed up for every club imaginable at the activities fair (I actually recommend this!), you will need to pare down so you can be meaningfully involved in a few activities, rather than barely involved in many. There will also be times when your friends want to go out to IHOP at midnight, but you have a Chemistry test the next day. It’s okay to say no; there will be other fun late-night trips, I promise.

## **3. CAF FOOD IS LESS THAN EXEMPLARY**

Of course it depends on your school, but typically cafeteria food gets real old, real fast.

## **4. SO IS THE UNION**

Unfortunately, you can only eat Chick-fil-a, Einstein’s, and Subway so many times before those get old, too.

## **5. IT TAKES EFFORT TO TALK TO YOUR PROFESSORS**

You know you’re supposed to talk to your professors, go to their office hours, blah, blah, blah. But _how_, exactly? What if you don’t have any questions and you’re doing fine in the class? Do it anyway. And that’s it. Sure, you might feel awkward, but please just do it. It does take effort, but it’ll be worth it.

## **6. STAY FLEXIBLE AND OPEN TO NEW EXPERIENCES AND CHANGING YOUR MAJOR**

Hahaha, it’s soooo cliche, but it won’t hurt to hear it again: it’s okay to change your major. College offers tons of cool campus events and seminars to learn about new activities and cultures and all sorts of stuff. In addition, you may end up enjoying a class way more than you thought you would. College is a time of change, so don’t be alarmed if you change your major, or start to see some changes in yourself! (Yes, I changed my major my second semester of college, lol)

## **7. EVERYONE NEEDS NEW FRIENDS**

Therefore, most people are friendly. This isn’t high school, so many people are new to the area and the school. There’s no need to hide.

## **8. CLIQUES DON’T EXIST, JUST TALK TO PEOPLE**

College kids are _nice_. One of my favorite things about college is that friend “groups” are so dynamic. I think smaller schools create this wonderful community where there’s only a few degrees of separation between people who know each other, and there are so many mutual friendships. I have become great friends with people who used to only be friends of friends (of friends).

## **9. THE MORE FRIENDS, THE BETTER**

See #8.

## **10. IN THE BEST WAY, NO ONE CARES**

I mean this to say, you will not be judged. All college kids are so weird, we just kind of accept that and move on with our lives. We are all trying to pass our classes, be relatively functioning humans, and hang out with our friends, so no one will care if you show up to lecture in a onesie. In fact, you might be even more respected for it.

What are some of your fears about your freshman year in college?
