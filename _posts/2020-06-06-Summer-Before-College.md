Congrats! Youâ€™ve graduated high school! Your diploma is in hand, youâ€™ve accepted an offer from a college (or are working
it out)... now what? You might be feeling a little bit disoriented about the next 2-3 months. You figured out how to do
high school, but whatâ€™s college going to be like?

Be glad you (probably) donâ€™t have any summer homework for the first time since elementary school, and read on for some 
**socially distant** activities to do before you head off on your next adventure!

## Wrap up loose ends
Make sure you download or copy transcripts from high school, including from any and all colleges you received college
credit from (even if it doesnâ€™t transfer to the college youâ€™re going to in the fall). This is for your own records, so
they donâ€™t have to be official copies, but do make sure you have one for every institution you attended and stick it in 
a place youâ€™ll remember. If you end up applying to grad school, you might need to know every single college class youâ€™ve
ever taken, including dual credit classes (\*cough\* med school \*cough\*).

## Get in touch with your roommate

Get to know each other, exchange contact info and social media, and check up on one another throughout the summer. Get a
head start on what will hopefully be an incredible friendship, and perhaps coordinate decor and basic supplies so you 
donâ€™t end up with two mini fridges and no microwave.

**Pro-tip:** my freshman year roomie and I made a shared Pinterest board with decorating ideas and colors.

## Gear up

Start compiling a list - somewhere you wonâ€™t lose, like on your phone - of things youâ€™ll need to pack at the end of 
summer. Starting a list early will give you enough time so youâ€™ll be less likely to forget things later. You can find 
oodles and oodles of college packing lists on the internet (Pinterest) and Iâ€™d recommend looking at a couple to start 
your own list and make sure youâ€™re not forgetting anything important. Your college also probably has its own suggested 
packing list.

## Decorate

If you couldnâ€™t tell already, Iâ€™m a huge fan of Pinterest. So if youâ€™re anything like me, youâ€™ll be eyeing ALL the
decorating ideas and ALL the DIYs. Or you might be stalking the aisles of Target looking for the perfect storage bins 
and wall decorations.

## Get hyped

Go to your schoolâ€™s website and look up a list of all their student organizations and club/intramural sports. Get 
excited about what you can be involved in! Or, if youâ€™re really ahead of the curve, look up professors in your 
department and read about their research. Depending on your university and schedule, you might be able to get involved 
in research as soon as your freshman year!

## Most of all, enjoy your summer!

Whatever your plans may be, take a moment to breathe and simply savor your time. ðŸ˜‰
