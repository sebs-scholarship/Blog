## **We Are Unwrapping A New chapter!**

Over the last two years the SEBS Scholarship Foundation has been providing exceptional graduating SEBS Students with scholarships to help fund their future. We are pleased to unwrap our big announcement just in time for the new year. We are expanding our mission to create the SEBS Alumni Foundation. We are excited to continue supporting SEBS graduates with scholarships, support our alma mater, and cultivate a community for past and current SEBS graduates.

We are thrilled to be expanding our mission and look forward to the many doors this opens for us. We are grateful to be part of such a close community. If you are interested in volunteering with us, we invite you to apply at [https://sebsscholarship.org/volunteer.](https://sebsscholarship.org/volunteer. "https://sebsscholarship.org/volunteer.")

### **Changes in Leadership**

We are saddened to announce that Holly Lakin has stepped down as the President of our foundation in order to focus on medical school. Holly had been with the foundation from the very start, and laid the stepping stones for us to grow into the alumni foundation we are today. None of this would have been possible without her leadership and guidance. We thank Holly for all of the work she has put into our foundation and wish her luck with medical school!

While Holly is irreplaceable, it is time to name a successor. After careful consideration, Levi Muniz has been elected to the role of president. Levi graduated SEBS in 2017. In 2019 he helped Holly co-found our organization Levi has continued to embrace the principles taught at SEBS into his young adult life and we could not ask for a better leader. We appreciate Levi's continued commitment and look forward to our future as a team.

Without the time and efforts of these SEBS Alumni our foundation wouldn't be possible. We thank our small but mighty team of volunteers for contributing their time and skills to help us succeed in our ever-growing mission.
