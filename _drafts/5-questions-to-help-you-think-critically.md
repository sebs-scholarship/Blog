Critical thinking is a common skill that schools try to teach and quantify at all levels. While not stated explicitly outside of education, critical thinking is also a super important skill in the workforce and general life. 

Ask these questions when you're trying to think more critically about a situation:

1. Is this source reliable?
2. What are the consequences?
3. How does this fit into the bigger picture?
4. Who does this impact and in what ways?
5. What are potential solutions and what are their extraneous consequences?

Obviously these aren't the only things you should consider, but you can use these to fuel further thought and/or discussion!
