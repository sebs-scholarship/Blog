##### Are you an alumni of The School of Engineering and Biomedical Science or Pueblo County High school? Do you have some spare time you’d like to be productive with? Do you enjoy helping others, and maybe want to give back to your community of Pueblo, Colorado!?!?!?

Well, do I have a (volunteer) job for you!!! Here are 8 reasons why I think you should join us as a volunteer here at the SEBS Scholarship Foundation.

## 1. You’ll reconnect with old classmates!

Sometimes this sounds like a nightmare but I PROMISE you won’t regret taking the chance to join up with some of your greatest old classmates. We have a strong team with a sense of security and community that not many organizations can offer. Personally, I find myself very fortunate to be a part of this team. Not only are my teammates my teammates, they are my friends too. Without this organization, I probably wouldn’t have gotten to reconnect!

## 2. YOU decide your workload!

Have 15 extra hours per week to spare to the foundation? Only have 2 extra hours per week? No worries. One of the perks of this volunteer gig is that YOU work the hours that YOU want to work. We want nothing more than for you to be successful in all of your endeavors, and our ability to be such a flexible organization allows you to prioritize while still helping make a difference!

## 3. Looks great on a resume!

Showing your commitment to a volunteer organization can boost your resume to the top of the pile. In college, you might notice that things like internships and scholarships can be very competitive. Having even one volunteer organization listed on your resume can set you apart from other applicants that may not have any volunteer experience.

## 4. You can work from just about anywhere in the world!

While some of us are still here, many of our volunteers have moved on from the town of Pueblo, CO to pursue their career and college dreams. The work done for our organization is all virtual, meaning you can work from Timbuktu or Australia if you so desire!

## 5. Support fellow SEBS students!

So many students these days can’t afford to go to college. Your work in this organization creates an opportunity for students attending SEBS to receive a scholarship that might be the reason they end up getting to go to college in the first place. We wish we could give every single student in SEBS a scholarship, but unfortunately that isn’t always possible. But, our scholarship isn’t the only service we offer- we have worked hard to create the very blog you are currently reading so that we can offer our sage advice to our college newcomers (or anyone that is interested!) The bottom line is, as SEBS alumni, we understand the rigor of the “SEBS life” during and after high school and want to help each and every student reach their potential in any way we can!

## 6. Give back to SEBS!

I don’t know about you, but I truly appreciate what I learned at SEBS- and not just the academic stuff! I had the most amazing mentors, and will never forget how much I learned and grew as a young adult because of SEBS. SEBS was my home away from home in high school and will always have a special place in my heart. To have an opportunity to give back to SEBS through current students is quite an honor.

## 7.You will learn a lot about teamwork!

Joining a volunteer organization will teach you some important concepts for “the real world,” especially teamwork. Almost everything we do here at the SEBS Scholarship Foundation involves working as a team. Each member in our organization has a mind full of ideas, and we have all learned to put our ideas together to make one great big concept and take our work to the next level! We can’t perform well without one another!

## 8. We need you!

We are a small organization and need more amazing volunteers to join our team. The more volunteers we have, the more we can accomplish. Everyone that joins has something incredible to offer, and nothing goes without being appreciated by the rest of the team.

I am pleased to be able to write on this blog and spread advice on things that I figured out the hard way. I enjoy doing anything I can to help students, especially from SEBS, and am always open for a conversation!_
